# cs329-homework3
This homework builds an end-to-end agentic workflow by combining LLMs with external APIs and self-improvement techniques.

## Setup

```bash
1. Download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/ and install
2. Create a new environment, and install the repo:

```bash
conda create -n cs329a-hw3 python=3.10 -y
conda activate cs329a-hw3
python -m pip install -e .  # Run this from root of the repo.
```

This will make sure the package is installed with requirements, so you can import functionality from `cs329a_hw3`.
